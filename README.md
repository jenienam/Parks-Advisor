# Parks-Advisor
The Parks Advisor was a team project. The goal of this project was to identify the different national parks in the United States and locate the different amenities provided. 

My job for this project was to identify the trails within the National Parks and to provide the amenities for each of the trails using a National Park Trails CSV from Kaggle.com. 

Pandas was used to clean the data to be exported into SQL. New CSVs were created for the trails in addition to all the amenities that the trails provide (i.e. animals, views, distance). A GeoMap with clusters through Javascript was created to visualize the different trails located in the United States. 

When a particular trail was clicked on, the difficulty rating, trail name, and amenities would be shown through a pop-up box to inform the viewer of the different characteristics of the trails. 

HTML was used for the visualizations of the website.
