    "For the park entrance fee table, we extracted information from the National Parks API (www.NPS.gov/api/v1). With a list of 56 identified national park codes, we were able to loop through the query urls (https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?parkCode=park&fields=entranceFees&api_key=) and gather entrance fee data for each park. One point worth noting is that each park charges differently for different entry options such as per vehicle, per motorcycle, and per individual. Since the entrance fee scenarios vary from park to park, we looped though the entrance fee dictionary for each park and pulled out all entrance fee conditions. Inside the loop, we assigned each piece of information, along with its park code, into a dictionary, and appended all of them into an empty park entrance fee list. \n",
    "To clean the data, we converted the result to a dataframe. Inside the dataframe, we changed all the park codes to upperacases so that they are unifrom among all our tables and can be used as primary/ foreign keys. We also converted the \"cost\" column type from string to float. The entrance fee list was then exported to csv and SQL for future uses. "
